# rwss

The **rwss** package implements reweighted smoothing splines (RWSS), in particular, **two-stage iteratively reweighted smoothing splines** ([**rwss**](https://github.com/rwss2021/rwss/blob/main/R/RWSS.R)). It is used to remove baselines when the structure of an acquired signal is complex, i.e., the signal with multiple and wide peaks, or when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low.
